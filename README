12V DC power supply multiplexer.

It was primarly designed to get a 2 level redundancy power
supply. 2 input sources - a 12V AC/DC wall adapter and a
regulated solar panel - are multiplexed using an application
specific logic implemented on a microcontroller. In the case
of a redundant power supply, the logic switches from one
source to another in case of low voltage detection.
